# Accrue Annuity Web App

### Overview
This app is a proof of concept fixed-income product using js React & Redux. The MVP for this product will be simple, sending money from Bob's wallet to a time-locked contract that will unlock at a time specified by Bob. Bob will be able to interact with the contract by expanding his interest-bearing position at the buy-in period and receiving fixed-income payments when the contract unlocks during the pay-out period.

The dashboard displays are pertinent information relating to Bob's investment including accrue target and goal, current reward % offered, next payout amount & date, how much total payout is remaining, etc.  The user will find the app easy to use, have all information needed while only providing a few focused areas to engage the contract. This idea was an inspiration from a financial product called a simple annuity.
